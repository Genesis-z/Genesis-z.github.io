<p><strong>What is server less computing ?</strong><br>It is a cloud computing execution model in which&nbsp; cloud provider acts as the server, dynamically managing the allocation of machine resources. Pricing based on the actual amount of resource consumed by an application.&nbsp; We don’t have to worry about the infrastructures.<br></p>

<p>Server less computing still requires servers. The name server less computing is used because the server management and capacity planning decisions are completely hidden from the developer or operator<br><strong>&nbsp;When server less computing comes into market ?</strong><br>The first "pay as you go" code execution platform was&nbsp;<strong>Zimki</strong>, released in 2006, but it was not commercially successfulIn 2008, Google released&nbsp;<strong>Google app Engine</strong>&nbsp;which featured metered billing for applications that used a custom Python framework, but could not execute arbitrary code<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Lambda">AWS Lambda</a>, introduced by Amazon in 2014, was the first public cloud vendor with an abstract server less computing offering.&nbsp; Other than this, we also have&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft Azure</strong>,&nbsp; Oracle's&nbsp;<strong>FN</strong>, IBM's&nbsp;<strong>Open whisk&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Google cloud functions</strong>.<br><strong>Why server less computing ?</strong><br></p>
