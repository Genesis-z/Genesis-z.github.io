<p>In this blog, we share the information which we had learned, explored and also experienced. Also we blog the information that we often forget ;). All Information are shared only for educational purpose.</p>

<p>But WHY here whilst there are more advanced blogging platforms?
Because, we loved Jekyll themes as they are quite smoother to manage once you get used to it. And also because - GITHUB!
Hope our work here, helps you out in some ways.
Cheers!
